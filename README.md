# Preprocessed-CMLR-Dataset-For-Wav2Lip
      Considering the original Wav2Lip was trained on LSR2 and didn't have good performance on Chinese. I preprocessed CMLR Dataset and would train Wav2Lip on CMLR. Wish it would do better in Chinese.  
      The CMLR dataset was collected by the Visual Intelligence and Pattern Analysis (VIPA) group of Zhejiang University(Their website:https://vipazoo.cn/CMLR.html). Thanks to their excellent work.
      As the VIPA group declared, this dataset is public to universities and research institutes for research purpose only. I actually use this dataset only for research in East China University of Science and Technology. If the VIPA group feel uncomfortable about my repository, please feel free to contact me via email（21013097@mail.ecust.edu.cn）
